### Specification for the `meta` structure (required)

* Contains metadata about the request.


### Specification for the `meta`/`request` structure (required)

* Contains the list of components included in the request along with the version number of each of these components.

* Having a component listed here does not mean it is required in the `components` section, however a component is required to have a version number if it is present in the `components` section.

* Version numbers will follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).


### Specification for the `requires` structure (required)

* Contains any requirements for the search.


### Specification for the `requires`/`response` structure (required)

* Contains the list of components required in the response along with minimal version for each of the components.


### Specification for the `components` structure (required, see `meta`/`request`/`components` above)

* Contains a list of the components for the search.

* Initially supported components will be:
  * exists
  * counts

* The `records` contains the record type requested:
  * phenopackets
  * mme
  * cloud-dos
  * any GA4GH patient data model


### Specification for the `components`/`queryIdentification` structure (required)

* Contains the query identification (required) and query label (optional) for the search.

* The query identification is a unique identifier generated by the querier.


### Specification for the `components`/`disclaimer` structure (optional)

* The legal disclaimers and terms of use.


### Specification for the `components`/`patientDescription` structure (optional)

* This is an optional section to support usage in networks such as the Matchmaker Exchange that require a backing patient to be offered with the query.

* `provenance` is an optional section that is in-place to support the documentation of `methods` and `data` that were used to generate the patient data that is being offered.

* The structure used to describe the patient can be of multiple multiple ontologies or networks such as MME, Beacon, and extensible to others as needed.


### Specification for the `components`/`submitter` structure (optional)

* The submitter for this search.


### Specification for the `components`/`contact` structure  (optional)

* The contact for this search if different from the submitter.


### Specification for the `components`/`search` structure (required)

* The search components for this search.

* Each search component will have a unique component ID (unique within the scope of this search request).

* Each search component will have a type which determines what other fields are present. The search component illustrate a sample of components and it not meant to be exhausting.

* Initially supported components will be:
  * gene
  * annotation
  * alleleFrequency
  * consequence
  * deleteriousnessPrediction
  * variant
  * zygosity
  * transcript
  * inheritanceMode
  * feature


### Specification for the `-or`/`-and` structure (optional)

* The section specifies how the search components are combined as a boolean search.
