## Search Request

This document describes a search request

This is work in progress....


### Structure

`HTTP POST` request to `<base_remote_url>/search`, with an `application/json` body with the following format:

* Questions:
 * Need to reconcile this with version number in the URL


### Specification for query at a high level.

### Specification for the `meta` structure (required)

* Contains metadata about the request.


### Specification for the `meta`/`request` structure (required)

* Contains the list of components included in the request along with the version number of each of these components.

* Having a component listed here does not mean it is required in the `components` section, however a component is required to have a version number if it is present in the `components` section.

* Questions:
  * Need to reconcile this with version number in the URL, since version numbers can be different for different components the version number in the URL should be removed.
  * Version numbers are for components which is fine except for the search items in the `search` components, those would probably need to be versioned.

{
    "meta": {
        "request": {
            "components": {
                "search": "1.0.0",
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```
{
    "meta": {
        "request": {
            "components": {
                "search": {
                    "gene": "1.0.0",
                    "type": "1.0.0",
                    "feature": "1.0.0"
                },
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Specification for the `requires` structure (required)

* Contains any requirements for the search.


### Specification for the `requires`/`response` structure (required)

* Contains the list of components required in the response along with minimal version for each of the components.

* Questions:
  * Do we want to support callbacks in searches, tell/allow the `host` to run the search offline and return the results at a later date?
  * Do we want to allow the `host` to arbitrarily run the search offline and return the results at a later date?


### Specification for the `components` structure (required, see `meta`/`request`/`components` above)

* Contains a list of the components for the search.

* Initially supported components will be:
  * exists
  * counts

* The `records` contains the record type requested:
  * phenopackets
  * mme
  * cloud-dos
  * any GA4GH patient data model

* Questions:
  * Do we want a records count limit?
  * Do we want to support offsets in record retrievals (start and limit)?
  * Do we want to require support for a minimal list of components?
  * Do we want to support multiple record types in a request?
  * What is the process for defining new record types?
  * Do we want to support defined sets of components/records for certain communities (MME)?
  * Do we allow _private_ components?
  * Why is `components` an array of objects?


### Specification for the `components`/`queryIdentification` structure (required)

* Contains the query identification (required) and query label (optional) for the search.

* The query identification is a unique identifier generated by the querier.

* Questions:
  * See question about callbacks in `requires`/`response` above.


### Specification for the `components`/`disclaimer` structure (optional)

* The legal disclaimers and terms of use.


### Specification for the `components``patientDescription` structure (optional)

* This is an optional section to support usage in networks such as the Matchmaker Exchange that require a backing patient to be offered with the query.

* `provenance` is an optional section that is in-place to support the documentation of `methods` and `data` that were used to generate the patient data that is being offered.

* The structure used to describe the patient can be of multiple multiple ontologies or networks such as MME, Beacon, and extensible to others as needed.

* Questions:
  * This needs work.


### Specification for the `components`/`submitter` structure (optional)

* The submitter for this search.


### Specification for the `components`/`contact` structure  (optional)

* The contact for this search if different from the submitter.


### Specification for the `components`/`search` structure (required)

* The search components for this search.

* Each search component will have a unique component ID (unique within the scope of this search request).

* Each search component will have a type which determines what other fields are present. The search component illustrate a sample of components and it not meant to be exhausting.

* Initially supported components will be:
  * gene
  * annotation
  * alleleFrequency
  * consequence
  * deleteriousnessPrediction
  * variant
  * zygosity
  * transcript
  * inheritanceMode
  * feature

* Questions:
  * Each search component needs to be specified (I think Orion Buske has some good information for that)
  * Do we want to require support for a minimal list of search components?
  * What is the process for adding search components?
  * Do we want to support defined sets search components for certain communities (MME)?
  * Do we allow custom search components?
  * Version numbering as defined above does not resolve to the search components, maybe it should?
  * `Operator` needs to be defined
    * EQ, NEQ, LT, LTE, GT, GTE
  * Need to figure out `sources` vs. `id` and CURIEs (I think Chris Mungall was maintaining a list of CURIEs) ?


### Specification for the `-or`/`-and` structure (optional)

* The section specifies how the search components are combined as a boolean search.
