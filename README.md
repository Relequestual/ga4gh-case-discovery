# GA4GH Discovery Search API

A standard for a global federated data sharing network that allows the querying, and subsequent -optional- processing of the results on a cloud environment.

Please note this standard is work in progress.

This generalized standard was inspired, adapted, and built up from existing work by:

* Global Alliance for Genomics and Health Discovery Search API [team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lzN_pu8tATZXUvDtFKSG7IevE5TWLfFz0tdKfgtUSzU)
* Requirements, design, brainstorming, and ideas gathered from the GA4GH driver project community, [summerized](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPPVhSvmzW5kK_rKTxkjPvxlcGicHhHPgO4cqqP3CBU/edit?ts=5a84936c#heading=h.4lfahcth694x).
* Orion Buske (@buske) and Ben Hutton (@relequestual) - [MME V2 Proposal](https://github.com/ga4gh/mme-apis/blob/version2-mock/version2/overview.md)

# Concept

We define the two actors involved as the `server` and the `client`, following HTTP semantics.

A server is a database or system which contains any number of cases and associated case data, which it is willing to perform searches on, and return data on.

A client is a system which makes search requests to a server (or many servers in a federated request) on behalf of a user and displays any results to the user, or based on instructions as part of a workflow (like a pipeline).

Unlike the MME API, there's no requirement for a client to make requests to a server on the basis of an existing patient record, allowing a user to construct any query they wish.

## Expected process

1. The client poses a question regarding a patient to the server. We define this as the `query`

    The query contains a collection of components which define specific aspects of the query. They query may also optionally specify that it requires specific types of data in the response for the response to be useful.

2. The server uses the query components provided to perform a search on its data

3. The server returns as much or as little of the data or metadata as it is able.
    
    The response may include as little as an assertion that some records exist for the query criteria, much in the same way Beacon works, or it may provide rich and full variant and phenotypic data for each case that fulfils the query criteria.

## Request and Response overview

The request a client makes to a server is over an HTTP POST, where the query is define in a JSON payload.

The main elements of the JSON query payload are `components`, `operators`, and `meta`.

The main elements of the JSON response payload are `records` and `meta`. An array of `records` will each contain any number of `components` which represent case data.

In both cases, the `meta` object is related to the query and response itself, and not any of the query or subject data.

The `components` that can be used in the query and response differ, although some are useable in both.

The `operators` may be used to define a single operator for all components (`AND` / `OR`), or define a more complex boolean logic query using components.

More details for the Request and the Response structure and meaning are provided on the respective pages.

JSON Schemas will be provided as a normative reference for the request and response.
OpenAPI specifications will be provided, but may be omitted for the initial release.

# Security

This specification is expected to support:

- Open data sources that do not require authentication
- Protected data sources that do require authentication

In the situation where a host requires authentication for access, the client should provide an authentication token located in a header field `X-Auth-Token`.

The authentication token may be a predefined token generated by the server specifically for the client, which they must exchange via a secure method such as GPG encryption using public and private keys.

The authentication token may be an O-Auth 2.0 barer access token provided in response to an O-Auth exchange, although how to achieve this is not specified. O-Auth 2.0 is recomended by GA4GH for authentication and authorisation purposes.


## API Version

Where `<api-version>` takes the form `vX`, where `X` is a major version. Minor versions are cross-compatible. The target semantic version will be specified within the `question` to help the host identify the target of the `question`. The URL of the host must specify the major version that it supports. 

For example:

`https://yournode.org/v1/search`


# Content type

The Content Type for a Request must be `application/json`.

The Content Type for a Response should be `application/json`, although it should be expected that in  the case of errors, the server may be prevented from returning JSON content.

The HTTP status code should be checked before attempting to process content. Severs may include error information in a JSON payload with a non `200` HTTP status code, but the structure of this is not defined.

## Content

* [The structure of the `question` document](search_structure/README.md)
* [The structure of the `result` document](result_structure/README.md)


## Example usage

These example constructs are based on use-cases from the driver projects and their feedback: [examples](example_usage/README.md)
