# GA4GH Discovery Search API

A standard for a global federated data sharing network that allows the querying, and subsequent -optional- processing of the results on a cloud environment.

Please note this standard is work in progress.

This generalized standard was inspired, adapted, and built up from existing work by:

* Global Alliance for Genomics and Health Discovery Search API team
* Requirements, design, brainstorming, and ideas gathered from the GA4GH driver project community, summerized [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPPVhSvmzW5kK_rKTxkjPvxlcGicHhHPgO4cqqP3CBU/edit?ts=5a84936c#heading=h.4lfahcth694x).
* Orion Buske (@buske) and Ben Hutton (@relequestual) - [MME V2 Proposal](https://github.com/ga4gh/mme-apis/blob/version2-mock/version2/overview.md)
* GePh-Query API ("Jeff") by Anthony J. Brookes and his team at the [Cafe Variome](https://www.cafevariome.org) discovery platform
* The merging of concepts, content, and building of first draft by Harindra Arachchi @harindra-a
* The Matchmaker Exchange APIs [@github](https://github.com/ga4gh/mme-apis/blob/master/search-api.md)


# Concept

We define the two parties involved as the `host` and the `querier`. 

1. The querier would pose a question regarding a patient to the host. We will define this as the `question`
2. The `question` will contain an `optional` patient data structure. While the Matchmaker Exchange (MME) requires a backing patient to be offered with any query, other networks may not. Therefore in order to make the standard general, we propose this value be `optional` and have the host decide whether to support that specific question. When they do not support, they will return a HTTP message such as `Not supported (status code: 512)`
3. The host uses the `query` section to find a set of results to return. We will define the structure it returns as the `result`
4. Within the `query` section there is a `components` section and an `operator` section that is applied to all the components.
5. `components` are used as the search criteria. Each `component` has one or more associated `filters` that apply specific rules to limit/sieve the search results of that specific `component` further
6. The object of the `operator` section is to designate whether `ALL` or `ANY` of the components to use in the query.
7. Within the top level `queryMetadata` structure, along with query details for tracking, there is field named `maximumNumberOfResultsRequested` that allows the querier to specify a limit on the number of results returned. This value can be superseded by any limit the host is able to support
8. The return results maybe scored, and/or sorted, by some host-internal mechanism, as expected from a typical database query, but it is not expected or guaranteed.


# OVERVIEW

**Submit patient search request:**
`HTTP POST` to remote server: `<base_remote_url>/<api-version>/search`
For example: `https://yournode.org/v1/search`


# Security

This specification is expected to support:

- Open data sources that do not require authentication
- Protected data sources that do require authentication

In the situation where a host requires authentication for access, the client should provide an authentication token located in a header field `X-Auth-Token`.

The authentication token may be a predefined token generated by the server specifically for the client, which they must exchange via a secure method such as GPG encryption using public and private keys.

The authentication token may be an O-Auth 2.0 barer access token provided in response to an O-Auth exchange, although how to achieve this is not specified. O-Auth 2.0 is recomended by GA4GH for authentication and authorisation purposes.


## API Version

Where `<api-version>` takes the form `vX`, where `X` is a major version. Minor versions are cross-compatible. The target semantic version will be specified within the `question` to help the host identify the target of the `question`. The URL of the host must specify the major version that it supports. 

For example:

`https://yournode.org/v1/search`


## Content type

Content type is expected to be `application/json`

For example:

`Content-Type: application/json`


## Content

* [The structure of the `question` document](search_structure/README.md)
* [The structure of the `result` document](result_structure/README.md)


## Example usage

These example constructs are based on use-cases from the driver projects and their feedback: [examples](example_usage/README.md)
