  Boolean logic "AND" and "OR" may be used to define the way in which components should be combined.
  Omitting the `logic` key is the same as defining "AND" for all components in the query.
  The value of `logic` must be an object, which must contain either the boolean logic operator key "-AND" or "-OR".
  The value of a boolean logic key must be an array, where the items in the array must be either
    - a JSON Pointer string, or
    - an object, which contains single boolean logic operator key, which follows the same rules as above.

  This is a recursive structure to allow for creating complex queries using boolean logic.

  A JSON Pointer (RFC6901) is a string which identifies a specific value within a JSON document.
  The JSON Pointer strings reference components, and must be prefixed with `/query/components`.
  The root of the document is the current document for this purpose.
  Support for boolean logic operators are optional.
